Rules of issue tracking.

If it involves a video file, your complaint must have a screenshot showing clearly damaged file behavior or serious defects in viewing. Minor defects like 1 second streaks or pixellation will be ignored. You didn't pay for any of the videos or code or the storage. Hosting large videos costs money. If you want full scale videos maybe donate on KoFi.com/strapples and I'll see about upgrading to Git LFS for this project.
