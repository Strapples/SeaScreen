Sea Screen Screensaver featuring cruise ships and any ship I wanna include/
All videos currently are from Videvo's free collections. (each file has a Videvo label in its name.)
Known Issues: 1. Video Quality on a few videos (These videos will be removed in a upcoming release) 2. No UI 3. Must be invoked by npm start (no app packages yet) 4. Randomization logic is unstable.

Rules of issue tracking.

If it involves a video file, your complaint must have a screenshot showing clearly damaged file behavior or serious defects in viewing. Minor defects like 1 second streaks or pixellation will be ignored. You didn't pay for any of the videos or code or the storage. Hosting large videos costs money. If you want full scale videos maybe donate on KoFi.com/strapples and I'll see about upgrading to Git LFS for this project.
